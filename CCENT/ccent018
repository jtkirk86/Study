##CCENT 018 - Configuring Trunking, VTP and VLANs

#Creating VLANS
	-'show vlan' - show current vlans that are configured
	- 'conf t' - global config mode
	-'vlan <##>' - configure specific vlan number
	-'name <name>'	- set the name of the current vlan
	-'description <description>' - set the description of the vlan
	
	-'int <interface>' - config the interface
	-'switchport access vlan <##>' changes the VLAN on a port
	-'interface vlan <##>' - creates a virtual interface on that vlan
	-'ip address <address> <subnet>' - from vlan interface config to assign it an address

*At least one port must be in the VLAN1 network for mgmt interface.
*Protocol Down means no other ports are in the same VLAN, so no communication is needed
