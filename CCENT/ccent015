##Switching: Cisco Switching - Day to Day

#Switch Notes
	-All items are set to auto detect by default
	-Auto did not work properly on 10mpbs and 100mpbs
	-100mbps should be hardcoded in switch for key devices
	-1000mbps should be set to aut

#Config
	-(Interface config) 'speed x' x = number
	-'duplex <type>' type = full, half

Lots of collisions mean duplex errors.
Lots of CRC errors may mean bad cabling.
